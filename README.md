# ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Due to covid, school and colleges have gone online and because of that i have seen teachers
struggling to maintain attendance so i have create ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM as my java
project to tackle that problem. 



## SOFTWARE USED 

I have used javafx for ui and mysql for database.

## HOW TO GET IT STARTED 
 Create a database named attendance_management_system using mysql then It's done if you are using local host, for better understanding check file DATABASECONNECTION.java
